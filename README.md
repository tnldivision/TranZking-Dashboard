# 🚛 tranzking Telemetry Engine & Live Dashboard :


A high-performance, real-time telemetry tracking system and live web dashboard built for the **TranzKing (tranzking)** division under **Tamilnadu Logistics (TNL)**. 

This repository contains the custom C++ SCS Telemetry Plugin, the Python Companion app, and a fully modular vanilla JavaScript dashboard.

## 🌟 Key Features

### ⚡ Real-Time Telemetry & Tracking
* **0.01s Non-Blocking Threading:** Telemetry uploads to Google Sheets run asynchronously in background threads to guarantee zero game micro-stutters or frame drops in ETS2/ATS.
* **10-Second Live Sync:** Fast live rider updates with aggressive cache-busting so active deliveries render on the dashboard instantly.
* **Smart "PAUSED" Deliveries:** Closing the game (Alt+F4 or exit) automatically saves the ongoing waybill to a local vault and flags the driver as `PAUSED` on the web dashboard with a live 48-hour countdown timer.
* **Auto-Cleanup & Duplicate Wiper:** Automatically wipes duplicate entries and handles crash recoveries gracefully upon game launch.
* **Anti-Glitch Distance Engine:** Blocks free-cam / dev-cam teleports (capped at 5km per tick) and resolves the 400,000 km odometer bug.

### 🎨 Modular Web Dashboard
* **Lazy Loading Architecture:** Heavy sheets (like Tour manifests) only fetch data when their specific tab is clicked, dramatically saving user bandwidth.
* **Dynamic Event Cover Engine:** Automatically translates event dates (e.g., `"07 Jun"`) to match full monthly cover banners (`"June 2026"`).
* **Hall of Fame & All-Time Stats:** Features driver name normalization (`normalizeKey()`) to correctly group stats across upper/lowercase variations and whitespace.
* **Smart DOM Caching:** Custom DOM update engine (`updateDOMIfChanged`) prevents screen flickering during polling.
